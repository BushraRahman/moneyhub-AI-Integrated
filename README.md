This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Welcome to MoneyHub Sessions!

## Getting Started

Once cloned, download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

In your root folder, create your .env.local file with the following:
```bash
MONGODB_URI= # your db connection string
LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:3000 OR http://localhost:3001
OPENAI_API_KEY= # your openai key
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

##Interface

This interface takes a Kahoot-like approach by creating sessions to check for understanding. At the end, educators get a report on their student's understanding.

1. Choose a lesson topic
